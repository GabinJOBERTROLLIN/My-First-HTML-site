## My First HTML Site
Made by BOUVET Victor and JOBERT--ROLLIN Gabin

The aim of this project was to understand how site is made by coding a functionning site in CSS, HTML and CSS. The site may be ugly, but it is fonctional.

My understanding of this subject will soon be improved when i will use webflow to make a site for "Synergie CPE Lyon" (a non-profit organization i am involved in)
